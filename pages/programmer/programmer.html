        I'm a third year Software Engineering student at RIT, orginally hailing from Yarmouth, Maine! When I was a kid, I was
        obsessed with computers. I was obsessed with how they worked, what they could do, and how they could be used to make life
        easier. Naturally that led to a desire to study software engineering. Much of my time has been spent in Python and Java.
        I am currently an Intern at Vets First Choice in Portland Maine, working on the implementation of a company wide Intranet.

        Somewhere along the way, I got a start in theater. I was never going to be an actor, a dancer, or a musician. What captured my attention was lighting and sound.
        Looking back, I think it was the very specific application of computing, being used to make productions come to life. Once I got a taste, I took off running.
        Much of my free time is spent, in some capacity, in the world of Theater and Production work.
